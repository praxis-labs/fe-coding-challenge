# Front-end Coding Challenge

This is a simple Typescript app created with Create React App.

The challenge is designed not to test Typescript knowledge, but to test how you can manipulate data into UI.

## Requirements

Use the existing boilerplate to create a table that displays the user data from the API.

![Manage Members Menu Closed](https://github.com/praxis-labs/fe-coding-challenge/blob/main/images/Members%20Table%20Menu%20Closed.png)

![Manage Members Menu Open](https://github.com/praxis-labs/fe-coding-challenge/blob/main/images/Members%20Table%20Menu%20Open.png)

The table must simply display all members in featured in `data.json` and include pagination. Don't worry about the ability to edit or delete a user; the menu options under the three dot icon are just for show.

We encourage you not to spend over an hour on this assignment. To speed up development time, we've configured Material UI and set up the API interface.

## Deliverables

At the end of this challenge you will have a Pull Request on your forked repo with the user table component(s) and unit tests.

You will be evaluated on:

1. Code clarity: if another developer were to look at your code would they be confused?
2. Accuracy of UI: did you create what was in the design?
3. Effective unit test(s): do your tests cover the essential logic of your components?
